# Roman Numeral Kata Solution

## Step 7: Extracting Variables

Let's review our code up to this point:

```swift
func format(_ number: Int) -> String {
    var arabic = number
    var roman = ""
    
    while arabic >= 10 {
        roman += "X"
        arabic -= 10
    }
    while arabic >= 1 {
        roman += "I"
        arabic -= 1
    }
    
    return roman
}
```

The two `while` loops are essentially the same. The only difference being the values that they work with.

Let's first extract those values out to local variables:

```swift
func format(_ number: Int) -> String {
    var arabic = number
    var roman = ""
    
    var arabicNumeral = 10
    var romanNumeral = "X"
    while arabic >= arabicNumeral {
        roman += romanNumeral
        arabic -= arabicNumeral
    }
    arabicNumeral = 1
    romanNumeral = "I"
    while arabic >= arabicNumeral {
        roman += romanNumeral
        arabic -= arabicNumeral
    }
    
    return roman
}
```

Letâ€™s rerun the tests to ensure no changes broke anything.

The code duplication is even more evident after extracting to use variables. We have fixed values for `arabicNumeral`
(`10` and `1`) and `romanNumeral` (`X` and `I`).

We will resolve this in the next step.
